# 🌳 Spirit Tree App 
**Grow your tree, heal the world.**

Spirit Tree is an interactive AFK experience where you can listen to lo-fi beats, watch your anime-style tree grow, and plant real-world trees through the Digital Humani API.

## ✨ Features
* **AFK Growth:** Earn "Sap" points automatically while the music plays.
* **Evolution:** Watch the tree transform from a seed to a giant spirit tree (Art coming soon!).
* **Real Impact:** Every 1,000 Sap points contributes to planting a real tree in a reforestation project.
* **Lofi Vibes:** Integrated music player for a relaxing atmosphere.
