        <h2>2. Data Management</h2>
        <p>Game progress is stored locally in your browser's cache. While we offer an email "Sync" feature via Formspree, this is used for session identification and marketing. We are not liable for lost "Guest" data due to cleared caches or browser resets.</p>

        <p>Spirit Tree Hub participates in various affiliate marketing programs. We may earn a commission on purchases made through links on this site. We are not responsible for the content or products of third-party websites linked here.</p>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
        <p>The "Spirit Tree" and "Zen Harvest" games are provided for entertainment. We do not guarantee 100% uptime. Your use of any information or materials on this website is entirely at your own risk.</p>

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to block access to the site for users who attempt to use automated scripts (bots) to farm reward points or watch ads fraudulently.</p>
